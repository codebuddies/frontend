## **Overview of Codebuddies**

### **What is CodeBuddies?**

[CodeBuddies](https://codebuddies.org/) is a remote-first community of independent code learners who enjoy sharing knowledge and helping each other learn faster via discussions and pairing. It is free and open-sourced, and supported by open source contributors and financial backers on our [Open Collective](https://opencollective.com/codebuddies).

### CodeBuddies website Version 3 (CBV3)

We are building out a new platform (CBV3) to replace an [older MeteorJS project](http://github.com/codebuddies/codebuddies) which currently runs the [codebuddies.org site](<(https://codebuddies.org/)>).

## Role of the front-end

The front-end is a React app that aims to let users at a bare minimum:

- submit resources
- meet remotely on Zoom to pair, show off a project, hack on an open source project, or study together.

## **Helpful links**

1/ CBV3's [backend](https://github.com/codebuddies/backend) API is built using Django and Django REST Framework.

2/ Some [Google doc technical notes](https://docs.google.com/document/u/1/d/1YuVO-v0n73ogoFIwpwJgI1Bkso8sP2mg5zqbX9FB3lU/edit#heading=h.rw88rxuk12cp) from hangouts/pairing sessions

3/ We have a technical decision log [here](https://github.com/codebuddies/frontend/wiki/Technical-decision-log) and a group blog experiment [here](https://github.com/codebuddies/frontend/issues/98)

4/ Crowdsourced [brainstorm of problems we want to solve](https://pad.riseup.net/p/BecKdThFsevRmmG_tqFa-keep) for our community with this platform
